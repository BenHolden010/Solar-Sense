## LEARNING GOALS
- Gain competency in TypeScript fundamentals and apply TypeScript concepts effectively.
- Develop proficiency in testing React components and asynchronous JavaScript code, including the use of Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Practice refactoring techniques to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- Create a multi-page user experience using React Router to handle routing and navigation.
- Apply real-world API integration and handle network requests, including error handling and data fetching.
- Utilizing session storage to keep track of a users saved locations.

## WINS/CHALLENGES 
### WINS
- Being able to successfully learn and implement TypeScript within a week to develop a comprehensive application.
- Effectively using session storage to have data persist on page refresh.
- Effective use of React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, allowing users to navigate through different views and components.
- Utilization of React Router to handle routing and enable multi-page functionality, enhancing the user experience.

### CHALLENGES
- Before using session storage, we attempted to use local storage. However, we decided to use session storage instead because we found that it was the better fit for our application.
- It was a challenge to not have access to JS event delegation, but instead use TypeScripts SyntheticEvents to target particular UI elements.
